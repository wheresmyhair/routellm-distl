The innermost parentheses are the two on the left side of the first line. So, we close them like this:\n[ [ ( { { ( { } ) } < < ( [ [ { } < [ { < [ { ( ) ( [ { } ] ) } ] < > > } ] ( < { ( [ ] ) } > ) > ] ( [ < ( ) > ] ) ] ) > > ]\n[ [ ( { { ( { } ) } < < ( [ [ { } < [ { < [ { ( ) ( [ { } ] ) } ] < > > } ] ( < { ( [ ] ) } > ) > ] ( [ < ( ) > ] ) ] ) > > ]\nStep 2: Now we close the next set of parentheses. The next set of parentheses is the one on the left side of the second line. So, we close them like this:\n[ [ ( { { ( { } ) } < < ( [ [ { } < [ { < [ { ( ) ( [ { } ] ) } ] < > > } ] ( < { ( [ ] ) } > ) > ] ( [ < ( ) > ] ) ] ) > > ]\n[ [ ( { { ( { } ) } < < ( [ [ { } < [ { < [ { ( ) ( [ { } ] ) } ] < > > } ] ( < { ( [ ] ) } > ) > ] ( [ < ( ) > ] ) ] ) > > ]\n[ [ ( { { ( { } ) } < < ( [ [ { } < [ { < [ { ( ) ( [ { } ] ) } ] < > > } ] ( < { ( [ ] ) } > ) > ] ( [ < ( ) > ] ) ] ) > > ]\nStep 3: Now we close the next set of parentheses. The next set of parentheses is the one on the left side of the third line. So, we close them like this:\n[ [ ( { { ( { } ) } < < ( [ [ { } < [ { < [ { ( ) ( [ { } ] ) } ] < > > } ] ( < { ( [ ] ) } > ) > ] ( [ < ( ) > ] ) ] ) > > ]\n[ [ ( { { ( { } ) } < < ( [ [ { } < [ { < [ { ( ) ( [ { } ] ) } ] < > > } ] ( < { ( [ ] ) } > ) > ] ( [ < ( ) > ] ) ] ) > > ]\n[ [ ( { { ( { } ) } < < ( [ [ { } < [ { < [ { ( ) ( [ { } ] ) } ] < > > } ] ( < { ( [ ] ) } > ) > ] ( [ < ( ) > ] ) ] ) > > ]\n[ [ ( { { ( { } ) } < < ( [ [ { } < [ { < [ { ( ) ( [ { } ] ) } ] < > > } ] ( < { ( [ ] ) } > ) > ] ( [ < ( ) > ] ) ] ) > > ]\nStep 4: Now we close the next set of parentheses. The next set of parentheses is the one on the left side of the fourth line.
