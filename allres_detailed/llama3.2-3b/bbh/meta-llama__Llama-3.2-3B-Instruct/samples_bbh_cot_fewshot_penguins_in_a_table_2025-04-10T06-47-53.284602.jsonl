To do this, we need to multiply the height of each penguin by its age and add up the results.  The height of Louis is 50 cm, so we multiply 50 by 7 to get 350.  The height of Bernard is 80 cm, so we multiply 80 by 5 to get 400.  The height of Vincent is 60 cm, so we multiply 60 by 9 to get 540.  The height of Gwen is 70 cm, so we multiply 70 by 8 to get 560.  The height of James is 90 cm, so we multiply 90 by 12 to get 1080.

The age of Bernard is 5, so we multiply 5 by 80 to get 400.  The age of Vincent is 9, so we multiply 9 by 60 to get 540.  The age of Gwen is 8, so we multiply 8 by 70 to get 560.  The age of James is 12, so we multiply 12 by 90 to get 1080.

To do this, we need to divide the total height of the penguins by the total age of the penguins.  The total height of the penguins is 3,130 cm, and the total age of the penguins is 3,130 cm.
