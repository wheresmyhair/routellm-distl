A screen pass is a type of play in football where the quarterback hands the ball off to a running back, who then tries to gain as much yardage as possible by running or passing the ball to a teammate. Catching is an action that can be performed by a receiver.\n3. **Evaluate the plausibility**: Given Josh Allen's position as a quarterback, it is highly unlikely that he would be the one catching a screen pass.
