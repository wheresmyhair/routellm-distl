{"doc_id": 558, "doc": {"query": "Economist? The personal income tax in the United States is a progressive tax, and the tax law is extremely complicated.People who want to pay taxes honestly often make mistakes in reporting because of misunderstandings; and those who deliberately avoid taxes always find loopholes in tax laws.Generally speaking, the size of tax avoidance space is directly proportional to the complexity of the tax system, and the level of tax avoidance capacity is directly proportional to the taxpayer's income level.Most of the tax avoidance space created by complex taxes will be used by the rich, making progressive taxation less than the degree of progress required by the tax law, and its function of regulating distribution is also greatly weakened.Q: If the following statement is true, which one provides the strongest support for economists' above argument? Answer Choices: (A)When filing taxes, 60% of the people in the United States need to hire professionals to report on their behalf, and 22% need to use tax reporting software to help them calculate.
