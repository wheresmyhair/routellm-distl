The problem involves a series of swaps between pairs of people, and the solution requires tracking the changes in the positions of the gifts after each swap. This type of problem is relevant to discrete mathematics and combinatorics, as it involves counting and arranging objects in different ways. The problem-solving strategy involves breaking down the sequence of swaps into individual steps, analyzing the changes in the positions of the gifts after each swap, and using logical reasoning to determine the final positions of the gifts.
